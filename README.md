# Simple Clean Architecture
I have created a minimal solution that follows Clean Architecture setup. I used few package references and simple code implementations to get you start up with clean architecture. It uses in-memory database for simplicity.

If you found an issue or want to get know more, please ping me here or on my linkedIn account: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-joseph-tigno/

# How to get the project running:
Build the solution by executing the following command commands:
- ```dotnet clean```
- ```dotnet restore```
- ```dotnet build```

To run the project:
- ```dotnet run --project .\src\SimpleCleanArchitecture.Api\```

Then open Swagger UI to test the REST API endpoints: https://localhost:5001/swagger
