# Simple Clean Architecture
I have created a minimal solution that follows Clean Architecture setup. I used few package references and simple code implementations to get you start up with clean architecture.

If you found an issue or want to get know more, please ping me here or on my linkedIn account: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-joseph-tigno/

# How to get the project running:
Build the solution by executing the following command commands:
- "dotnet clean"
- "dotnet restore"
- "dotnet build"

To run the project:
- "dotnet run --project .\src\SimpleCleanArchitecture.Api\"

Then open Swagger UI to test the REST API endpoints.
"http://localhost:5000/swagger"
